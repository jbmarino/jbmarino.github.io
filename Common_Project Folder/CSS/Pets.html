            <p> Ginger is a 6 year old Chesapeake Bay Retriever. Her favorite activities are swimming in our pool and running around our yard. Occasionally she likes to chase after squirrels and groundhogs that pop up around our yard. She also likes to hog all the dog toys in the house so nobody else can have them. She enjoys antagonizing her younger brother Hank, and you can usually see them rough housing around the house.</p>
            <p>When Ginger is not playing she enjoys sitting in her bed unbothered. She will go onto her bed, and then will turn on her selective hearing. That is when you know that she will side-eye you for anything you are doing.</p>
